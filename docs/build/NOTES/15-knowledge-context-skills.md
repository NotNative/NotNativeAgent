# P10 knowledge/context build notes

## P10-1: storage boundary (2026-09-26)

`GET /api/project-context/:projectId` and `PUT .../todos` now use
`projects/<projectId>/context.json`, while general project settings and
scheduled-task metadata remain in `projects/<projectId>.json`. The todo writer
uses an atomic temporary-file rename and the same project lock as config and
scheduled-task writers. Missing context is empty; malformed context is an
error and is never replaced with an empty document.

When the new context file is absent, the read path accepts legacy `notes`,
`projectNotes`, `todos`, `projectTodos`, and `plans` values in the config file.
It keeps the old file intact and seeds the new file on the first todo write.
Ambiguous aliases or a nonempty `projectPlanFiles` list fail closed to avoid
hiding content. This is intentionally less than the full D.5 migration in
planning document 15: plan-file copy-in, removal of legacy keys after a
durable migration, and convergence across multiple processes are still owed.
Config PUT preserves these legacy keys before seeding and rejects attempted
changes through the wrong route. Once a valid context file exists, config PUT
can remove its now-redundant legacy keys.

The shared config-lock queue now consumes rejected bookkeeping outcomes; the
actual rejected operation still reaches its caller. A deliberate malformed
context test exposed the previous unhandled-rejection behavior.

## Remaining P10 slices

- Finish legacy plan-file migration and durable legacy-key cleanup.
- Add notes and plan CRUD, safe markdown file ownership, shared plans, and
  attachment lifecycle.
- Bind the UI context tabs and project todos to this canonical store; add
  chat-owner/worktree resolution and memory/skills/MCP surfaces.

Do not label P10 complete until the planning document's contracts and
failure paths are covered by tests and UI verification.
