# Integration work ledger — NotNativeDesktop native NNA integration

Owner: lead implementation agent (this session).
Governing guides: [PLAN](../PLAN.md), [EXECUTION 01-05](../PLAN.md). Baseline:
NND `e425a25` / `20261001-42`; NNA `7363ad1c2f...` / `20261001-6`. Both trees
started clean (verified 2026-10-01). Status vocabulary follows guide 05:
`open`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `implemented-unverified`, `verified`.

Ground rules (from the guides and both repositories' AGENTS/README):

- NNA stays independent; its TUI keeps tabs/sessions. NND is a separate optional
  package. NNA supervises the persistent NND service. Browser and desktop share
  NND's service and session collection. No auto-accept, no Full control, no TUI
  merge. NNA owns execution, governance, configuration authority, engine truth.
- Slice order: L1 first; independent inventories/tracing may run in parallel.
- Every slice: focused checks + `npm test`/`pnpm test`, adversarial review by a
  non-author, evidence update, graph/report refresh, version bump, verified
  commit (NNA dependencies commit before NND consumers).
- Distinguish `implemented-unverified` from `verified`. Mock success never closes parity.

## Grounded source facts (verified this session, 2026-10-01)

| Fact | Evidence |
|---|---|
| NNA has no `nna service` CLI; only `nna nnd serve` and `nna nnd package {activate,deactivate,status}` | `D:\ProjectRepo\NotNativeAgent\src\cli.js` dispatch + help text |
| `runNndIntegrationCommand` creates the engine host **before** the integration server; `readIntegrationManifest` throws on missing/invalid manifest; no setup-required state | `src\integration-cli.js` (`runActivatedIntegrationCommand`, `createIntegrationNndEngineHost`) |
| `nnd serve` emits one JSON ready frame to stdout; token in frame; no supervision, no singleton, no health module | `src\integration-cli.js`; no `service` case in `cli.js` |
| NNA activation contract: `nno-integration-activation.js` (NNO installed-manifest validation) vs `createNndLocalIntegrationActivation()` (unvalidated local activation; identity checked only when `NNA_NND_INSTALL_ROOT` is set via `assertRegisteredNndPackage`) | both files |
| `nnd-package.js` validates manifest `id: nnd-local`, ownership `nnd`, scope `local-gui`, protocol `1.0`, `VERSION = /^\d{8}-[1-9]\d{0,5}$/`, requires `packages/electron/dist-server/server.mjs` + `packages/web/dist/index.html`; registry `nnd-package.json` in config root | `src\nnd-package.js` |
| NND installed service entry exists but is only an NNA-launched child contract; sets `NOTNATIVE_NNA_MODE=managed`, `NNA_NND_INSTALL_ROOT`, disables browser bridge | `scripts\serve-installed.mjs` |
| Electron shell imports the server bundle **in-process** (`main.mjs` "Hard invariant: server runs IN-PROCESS"); tray `quitFromTray()` disposes the server handle; login item registers the **shell** (not a supervisor) | `packages\electron\main.mjs` |
| Shell uses stale `OPENCHAMBER_*` env names (e.g. `OPENCHAMBER_SERVER_URL`, `OPENCHAMBER_ELECTRON_LOAD_SERVER_UI`) alongside `NOTNATIVE_*` | `packages\electron\main.mjs` |
| Application port env: `NOTNATIVE_PORT`; dev ports 3902/5180/3000 per DECISIONS.md | `main.mjs`, `docs\build\DECISIONS.md` |

## Cross-repository contracts

The [activation contract](nnd-local-activation-contract.md) replaces the interrupted
agent's draft. Paired validators and review passed in NND 20261001-43 / NNA 20261001-7.
No existing supervisor, startup registration or installed acceptance is claimed.

## Recovery of the interrupted handoff

The handoff contained only this ledger, the contract draft and three untracked NNA
contract/test files. No implementation commit had landed after the pinned baseline.
The draft reversed NNA/NND process ownership, partitioned singleton ownership by
package root, omitted readiness facets and schema fields, and proposed a circular
release digest. These were repaired before L2 consumes the contract.

## L1 contract sub-slice evidence

Versions: NND 20261001-43; NNA 20261001-7. Contract validators and optional package
artifact admission are implemented. Legacy registration remains supported; explicit
service admission checks host capabilities. NND checks declared schema before startup
environment mutation. Paired source agreement and failure cases pass. Adversarial
review repaired a digest that could otherwise cover a helper instead of the server.

L1 remains in-progress: installed descriptor/independent TUI acceptance is outstanding.
L2 is not implemented; no new service capability is advertised. Full build completion
requires every remaining L/C/F/V row. NNA native-platform release certification is
separate from the source suite and has not been refreshed for this source slice.

## L1/L2 installation identity and singleton sub-slice

NNA 20261001-8 / NND 20261001-44. Source helpers now validate an explicitly selected
installed descriptor, contained native CLI/payload metadata and actual recorded
Node runtime. Canonical path identities preserve the same data identity across
installation moves; no PATH fallback or installed-file mutation occurs.

The Windows kernel named-pipe lock excludes concurrent and separate-process writers
for the same canonical data root, including junction/case aliases. Normal close is
idempotent and loss is observable. It contains no credentials or command protocol.
Service wiring, private Windows discovery storage and shared external-catalog locks
remain open. NND's paired endpoint contract also accepts explicit port 80 without
relaxing literal-loopback or valid-port checks.

Independent adversarial review found no further confirmed defects. Focused Windows
identity/lock/contract cases pass. Final full-suite and release evidence is recorded
in the paired commits. L1 still needs installed TUI independence acceptance; L2 remains
in-progress and service capabilities remain unadvertised. No installed operator
profile, startup entry, TUI state or running NNA was changed.

## L2 private directory and C1 working census

NNA 20261001-9 (`3c0ec7bf`) implements local-fixed-drive Windows private runtime
protection. It checks native ACLs, ancestors, null DACLs, foreign inheritance and
reparse points, then creates missing directories with protected ACLs. Existing ACLs
and evidence remain untouched. No credential files or lifecycle commands are wired.
Eight native ACL cases passed; full NNA suite passed 1,681 with five platform skips.
Mapped network drive rejection is code-reviewed; no live share was used for testing.

[Settings coverage working census](settings-coverage.json) contains 357 unique source
rows in 38 families, including four route roles and 17 TUI bindings. All rows remain
open, unknown values are explicit, and remaining census families are listed. This is
not a count of editable settings: containers/actions/internal/authority rows differ.
C1 remains in-progress pending complete enumeration, defaults/bounds/apply/permission
mapping and a new-key coverage gate. Existing native/GUI mismatches remain open.

## L2 protected controller discovery

NNA 20261001-10 / NND 20261001-46 implement protected controller discovery helpers.
An internally generated controller credential stays in a protected immutable
generation file; the current pointer contains no credential. Publication and
removal require a genuine held data-root lease and exact expected generation,
serialized by an exclusive file handle. Readers verify each file's ACL and
bounded structure. A discovery record is not proof of a live service.

Independent review found early lease release during helper cancellation and
retention growth across normal generation replacement. Repairs preserve ownership
until filesystem work has stopped and retire only the validated predecessor after
committed publication. Failed retirement does not misreport publication rollback.
Malformed and unpublished orphan evidence is preserved with a capacity limit.

The paired pure contract exposes its existing endpoint validator for reuse.
No lifecycle CLI, controller listener, installed service or GUI migration is
claimed. L2 remains in-progress. Setup-first hosting and native UI authentication
are the next integration boundaries; source helpers alone do not close them.

## L2 setup-first hosting and L3 native UI authentication

NNA 20261002-1 / NND 20261002-1. Local native integration now listens before
session restoration. Authenticated health/setup status stays reachable while
starting or unconfigured. Setup status and explicit activation require separate
native permissions. Missing/corrupt configuration is preserved; activation uses
a bounded UTF-8 manifest with an explicit absolute workspace. No initial save or
configuration repair concurrency is claimed. Provider connectivity remains unknown.

Independent review repaired failed-cleanup retries, slow restoration hiding the
setup listener, and held SSE responses blocking shutdown. Timed-out work remains
owned; late candidates are cleaned up and uncertain cleanup blocks retry. NNO
keeps its existing activation/secret realm. Setup does not admit execution, raw
secret use or provider probes until the native host is ready.

NND has a privileged `startServer({ nativeAuth })` seam for supervised startup.
It requires UI authentication even without a password. UI-only access tickets
are short-lived, bounded, one-use and redeemable only by the matching origin and
actual loopback peer. HTTP only redeems tickets; issuance is on the private server
handle. Session signing is memory-only per generation. Password/passkey behavior
is preserved with separate persistent passkey binding. Legacy device credentials
and pairing are explicitly unavailable in native mode pending native device scope.

Browser entry renders the advertised access-code form, posts the code in a body,
checks cookie admission and cancels on host change. Successful native redemption
clears stale injected bearer credentials. Revocation closes the service transports;
WebSocket admission uses the actual Host and dev-tunnel disposal cancels pending
and existing sockets. Audit and focused tests passed; full checks run before commit.

These seams do not yet switch the installed launcher, renew engine principals or
start a supervised GUI child. L2/L3 remain in-progress; L4-L6/C/F/V remain open.

## L2 composed supervisor and L3 private child attachment

NNA 20261002-2 / NND 20261002-2. Explicit native service commands now compose the
selected installation, data-root lease, setup-first runtime, protected discovery,
controller and registered NND child. The dedicated native listener derives fixed
operator permissions and configured workspace grants per request. Child authority
headers are ignored; no principal refresh or permission minting occurs in NND.

NND's explicit `--supervised` installed path validates package/version/platform,
bounded metadata and actual bundle hash before importing the server. Private
bootstrap/control frames carry the native token in memory; renderer/environment/
argv do not receive it. Ready frames bind generation and package identity. EOF,
malformed frames or parent loss revoke attachment and close transports. UI-only
codes issue over the private child channel through authenticated native control.
Source installer metadata generation now hashes the built artifact.

The disposable installed-payload smoke passes with copied native CLI and the genuine
built NND bundle: setup-required service, locked browser, one-use UI code, guarded
session execution, generation-bound status and graceful controller stop. No operator
installation changed. Native/desktop release certification remains separate.

Adversarial repairs include false process-exit proof after child errors, duplicate
readiness frames, selected-root credential loading, and pending provider mutations
after socket closure. Stop admission and dispatch drain precede lease release.
Smoke preserves its fixture when descendant termination cannot be established.

Fresh-data admission explicitly refuses existing manifest/session/tab data before
opening its catalog. Current legacy serve uses the same lease; older installed
hosts and data need verified migration. No broad TUI lock was introduced: its
catalog is separate. Desktop attachment, login startup, restart policy, generic
setup save and C/F/V product acceptance remain open. L2/L3 remain in-progress.

## L3 atomic admission, L4 desktop client and L5 mutation guards

NNA/NND 20261002-3. Native capabilities and atomic attach return selected identity,
generation, GUI endpoint and UI-only ticket; status validates the full paired schema.
Electron verifies the actual recorded Node and payload versions before native CLI
execution. Its private memory Chromium session redeems the ticket and backs all
native windows. Closing Electron preserves the NNA service. Reconnect replaces
generation sessions; there is no silent managed/local or remote fallback.

Actual Chromium acceptance passed in a disposable installed-payload fixture:
cookie authenticated, renderer bearer/authority headers empty, independent browser
still locked, and native service generation unchanged after shell quit. Audits fixed
menu Quit cancellation, selected runtime admission and credential environment loss.

Installer/uninstaller mutation now holds the same native lease. A protected marker
blocks startup after interrupted guard death. Explicit release plus EOF follows only
verified successful package changes; failed mutations abandon and retain evidence.
Removal validates roots, excludes reparse ancestors and unlinks internal junctions
before recursive removal. Disposable Windows PowerShell guard/removal probes passed.
No actual operator installation, removal or startup registration was performed.

L4 is in-progress; L5 is in-progress. Existing-data/grant migration and interrupted
installation recovery remain open, as do login startup, native device attachment,
complete settings and feature acceptance. Native full validation uses an isolated
checkout to preserve concurrent OpenCode protocol development.

## Slice 20261002-5 — configured admission, credential management and source identity

Native configured-NNA adoption now preserves unrelated manifest/TUI/journal data.
It requires the actual held data-root lease, checks bounded Windows legacy owners
on every startup, and syncs a protected selected-identity admission receipt.
Prior valid supervised receipts remain supported. Legacy NND catalogs and orphan
child/activity sidecars still require explicit migration; no grants are rewritten.
Unsupported pre-lease executable autostarts must be disabled: current process
census cannot guarantee that a different older executable never starts later.

The native GUI principal gains exact secret metadata/manage/audit operations with
broker scope checks. It has no secret-use, deployment-scope or wildcard grant.
Actual HTTP tests cover setup-required and ready states, rotation, foreign-scope
rejection, caller header forgery and plaintext retrieval denial.

The source seal includes root installers and Electron code/assets. Generated
build stamps and installed mode flags are excluded. Three release-content tests
include source digest changes, stable generated output and Windows junction refusal.
Independent adversarial audits applied portability and generated-file repairs.
Full UI: 1,630 passed. Native full suite: 1,742 passed, six skipped. Native quality,
actual composed/Chromium smokes, regenerated graphs and final release gates passed.
The real Chromium probe found transient discovery polling could abort shutdown.
Bounded retries now apply only to Windows sharing/lock contention. Fourteen
discovery tests and actual Chromium shutdown passed, with independent audit.
Native validation includes committed OpenCode version 20261002-4; this slice
advances native to 20261002-5. The prior uncommitted NND candidate seal remains
immutable; the corrected current evidence advances NND to 20261002-5.
Remaining lifecycle gaps: explicit legacy migration, login startup, transactional
upgrade/rollback and interrupted installation recovery. Setup repair and complete
native settings GUI remain open.

## NND 20261002-6 — native setup presentation

The providers page reads authenticated native setup status and offers explicit
refresh and activation. It separates saved configuration and execution readiness
from unchecked provider connectivity. Missing or invalid configuration still needs
independent NNA setup: this panel does not create, repair or replace the manifest.
Activation does not alter permissions or existing sessions. No automatic activation
or provider inference is introduced.

The client bounds responses, validates native state, preserves setup status returned
with activation HTTP 503, and hides raw errors. Runtime changes, authentication
transitions and unmount cancel pending requests and discard late results. Activation
is disabled while pending or after native cleanup/timeout failures requiring restart.
Independent audit found no confirmed production defect. Added regressions cover auth
expiry during activation, late completion, read-only reauthentication and both native
restart-required failures. Existing provider assertions now isolate the unrelated
setup transport. Full UI: 1,639 passed across 204 files; type and quality gates
passed for 737 production modules. Packaging and release checks remain mandatory
before committing this slice.
C3 remains in-progress; generic configuration save, repair and complete settings
coverage remain open. This slice consumes native APIs already committed in NNA
`31fd90b1`; concurrent OpenCode protocol changes are a separate subsystem.
